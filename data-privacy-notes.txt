DATA DISCLAIMER:
By using <app>, we would like to request access to some of your data. We want to make it very clear that the owner of your data is you.
Currently, we use your data to:

	in strictly anonymized form, your data, along with some demographic information will (may? opt-in?) be used to allow for an aggregate measure about how your community is managing burnout

We will never use your data to identify you and we will never uniquely disclose your data to another user.

In the future, we may request your consent to use your data for research to develop a predictive model for burnout. At that time, we will provide this as opt-in research that does not affect your use of the application.
